          <h3>Differences between HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h3>
          <p>The Sprint 3 was quite a challenge for me because I couldn't digest JavaScript as quick as HTML and CSS. Although my thirst for learning JavaScript is getting stronger, I'm aware that my brain got a bit of shock from learning completely new logic. It's like my taste buds are paralysed when I first tried super hot curry. If you feel the same way, I would say we will be fine. Our body will eventually get used to this new encounter. We are just not there yet.</p>
          <p>Anyway, here it is about differences between HTML, CSS and JavaScript "metaphorically".</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>HTML</strong> &mdash; is like a lunchbox container. It is a receptacle where you can partition a room into smaller rooms. Each room contains foods that are not cooked, but are grouped well enough to understand what these ingredients are going to become.</li>
            <li><strong>CSS</strong> &mdash; is like a method to cook these ingredients in a way that people can appreciate to eat. Now we can enjoy the multiple dishes in this lunchbox visually and deliciously. These could be warm/cold, spicy/sweet or colourful/minimum.</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> &mdash;  is like a feature that is built in the lunchbox. It could be a simple button that warms up the food inside immediately. Or it could be a feature that insulates the temperature of food individually. It provides rich experience in a craft.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Control flow and loops</h3>
          <p>After I first read about how control flow and loops work, I really needed to have a tea break. I'm a visual person. I just couldn't visualise the algorithms from the learning resources I had. However, I've come to understand them after I created an example from everyday life. I think the key to understand difficulty is to convert complex into simplicity so that I can familiarise myself with unfamiliar. So here is my brilliant explanation about control flow and loops!</p>
          <h4>if-else and switch</h4>
          <p>Let's take a look at the example of how <span class="highlight"><strong>if else</strong></span> and <span class="highlight"><strong>switch</strong></span> can be used within a context of everyday life with an example of psychic dog I've never had.</p>
          <h5>Example with if else</h5>
          <pre class="prettyprint"><code>if (my dog barks once) {
  "Cuddle him"
} else if (my dog barks twice) {
  "Give him a snack"
} else if (my dog does NOT barks at all) {
  "Grab his toy and go for a walk"
} else {
  "Assume he is talking to a ghost"
}</code></pre>
          <h5>Example with switch</h5>
          <pre class="prettyprint"><code>switch (my dog) {
  case barks once:
    "Cuddle him" 
    break
  case barks twice:
    "Give him a snack"
    break
  case barks three times:
    "Grab his toy and go for a walk"
    break
  default:
    "Assume he is talking to a ghost"
}</code></pre>
            <p>So what's happening here is basically an <strong>if else</strong> is used for taking a true or false decision whereas a <strong>switch</strong> statement is used to test the condition against a list of case. As you read through the script in the if example, you must have answered yes or no to given conditions subconsciously. On the other hand, you must have chosen the most relevant answer to your situation in the switch example.</p>
            <p>To give more solid understandings on them, here is a brief comparison between these two:</p>

              <article class="card col-2-dt col-2-tb bg-primary">
                <h3>if else</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>The expression decides whether to execute the statements</li>
                  <li>Checks for equality and logical expression</li>
                  <li>Evaluates integer, character, pointer or floating-point type or boolean type</li>
                  <li>Difficult to edit and tedious to trace</li>
                </ul>
              </article>
              <article class="card col-2-dt col-2-tb bg-primary">
                <h3>switch</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>The expression decides which case to execute</li>
                  <li>Checks only for equality</li>
                  <li>Evaluates only character or an integer datatype</li>
                  <li>Much simpler to edit and easy to trace</li>
                </ul>
              </article>

          <h4>while, do-while and for</h4>
          <p>These three are loops. Again, I was very confused with how to differentiate them. But the key to understand these three is to know when the statement is executed and how many times. Let's take a look at this example.</p>
          <pre class="prettyprint"><code>while (my crush is interested in me) {
  "Show my affection"
}</code></pre>
          <p>When you use <span class="highlight"><strong>while</strong> loop</span> like above, your execution continues infinitely as long as you meet the condition.</p>
          <pre class="prettyprint"><code>do {
  "Show my affection"
} while (my crush is interested in me)</code></pre>
          <p>Like the example above, both <strong>while</strong> and <strong>do while</strong> can loop the execution forever while the condition is met. But there is a big difference between these two.</p>
          <p>In while loop, I never try to show my affection while I know my crush is <strong>NOT</strong> interested in me, whereas I give it a shot only once in the <span class="highlight"><strong>do-while</strong> loop</span> above while I know my crush is <strong>NOT</strong> interested in me. In terms of making an important life choice, I personally like to try at least once. However, I just need to be smart enough to know whether to use while or do-while when living in JavaScript world.</p>
          <p>What about another loop, <strong>for</strong>?</p>
          <pre class="prettyprint"><code>for (12 years old now; my crush is interested in me till I turn 18; getting older) {
  "Show my affection"
}</code></pre>
<p>This is like I somehow figured out my first love won't last long, and I see this teenage love is temporary. So I've decided to show my affection till I graduate high school. What a kid... Apart from how realistic I am (metaphorically speaking), I know how many times I want to loop the execution when I use <span class="highlight"><strong>for</strong> loop</span>.</p>
          <h3>What is DOM?</h3>
          <p>Perhaps, enough with metaphors so far. I'll make this blog article sound a bit more academic! Let's have a look at this section a bit seriously.</p>
          <p>DOM is a model that handles document as object. In other word, it is an interface to manipulate HTML/XML by programming. DOM allows us to address a specific part of files and send a command like "I want to do this action(event) at this part(object)." DOM also features:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>creating a hierarchy called tree structure.</li>
            <li>can be described in notes.</li>
            <li>connects between Web page and programming language like JavaScript.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>DOM allows us to not only change the contents of web page but also change styles. It can also specify notes that you want to modify while adding ID attribute as "mark".</p>
          <!-- <p>Understood? maybe? I think most resources I found on the internet make DOM sound too complicated. DOM is actually everywhere around us. I think smart people are just trying to be smart despite the fact that they are. Well, DOM is actually pretty simple.</p> -->
          <!-- <p>If you have ever written a letter or send a gift to someone by post, you must have written a physical address on it. Firstly, your street number and then your street name unless you live in a fancy apartment. You normally put your region next, and a name of the city you live in. Finally, you put a name of the country if sending to overseas.</p> -->
          <!-- <p>I think it's clear that there is a hierarchy in there. It's just a backward. You see Country is the top of this tree structure. Then you narrow down your destination by City, Region, Street and so on.</p> -->
          <p>Let's take a look at DOM in action. I quickly made a demo below:</p>
          <p class="codepen" data-height="460" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="keinskyrocket" data-slug-hash="bGgzPWG" style="height: 460px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="How DOM interacts">
            <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/keinskyrocket/pen/bGgzPWG">
            How DOM interacts</a> by Keisuke (<a href="https://codepen.io/keinskyrocket">@keinskyrocket</a>)
            on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
          </p>
          <script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
          <br />
          <p>Firstly, what I did here down below is assigning <span class="highlight">document.getElementById("pandora")</span>to <strong>x</strong> because this makes the code look tidier.</p>
          <pre class="prettyprint"><code>const x = document.getElementById("pandora");
//var y = document.getElementById('pushMe');
//if (x.style.display === "none") {
  x.style.display = "block";
//  y.value = "Hide again";</code></pre>
          <p>And there is no secret about this is what it was originally. If I translate this into human language, it will be: I'm going to assign <span class="highlight">value: block</span> to css attribute <span class="highlight">display</span>, and apply this to ID called <span class="highlight">pandora</span>. Basically I specified the location where I want to apply the css style by this line.</p>
          <pre class="prettyprint"><code>
document.getElementById("pandora").style.display = "block";
          </code></pre>
          <h3>Difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h3>
          <p>I'll go over this section nice and easy. Simply put, arrays access data by referencing index whereas objects do so by referencing property.</p>
          <pre class="prettyprint"><code>const arr = ["Land", "Air", "Ocean"];
console.log(arr[0]);</code></pre>
          <pre class="prettyprint"><code>const obj = {
  Strength: "Alcohol",
  Weakness: "Puppies",
  Charm: "Nail colour"
};
console.log(obj.name);</code></pre>
          <h3>What are functions and why are they useful?</h3>
          <p>According to the definition of JavaScript found on W3Schools website, a JavaScript function is <span class="highlight">a block of code designed to perform a particular task</span>, and is <span class="highlight">executed when "something" invokes it (calls it)</span>. To supplement my understanding it slightly better, I made a list of things that function can do below:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Group multiple commands into one</li>
            <li>Pass multiple values</li>
            <li>Return values</li>
            <li>Create a scope</li>
            <li>Reusable</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This is at least what I know about JavaScript, and there should be more going on to the list! Here is an example of what difference function can make.</p>
          <h5>Before</h5>
          <p>This basically shows you an alert message saying "Greetings!" when you open the page. It is only one-time event.</p>
          <pre class="prettyprint"><code>
alert("Greetings!");
          </code></pre>
          <h5>After</h5>
          <p>When you want to add a bit of interactivity, here if what you can do. This code shows a button called Hit me!, and you will see an alert window saying "Greetings!" when you click the button. Instead of showing the alert window passively, you can proactively control a set of tasks such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Have a button on a page</li>
            <li>Trigger a modal window by clicking the button</li>
            <li>Display the modal window</li>
            <li>Show a massage in the modal window</li>
          </ul>
          <pre class="prettyprint"><code>
&lt;button onclick="hitMe()"&gt;Hit me!!&lt;/button&gt;
          </code></pre>
          <pre class="prettyprint"><code>function hitMe() {
  var myText = "Greetings!";
  alert (myText);
}</code></pre>
          <p>Although I have only started creating easy functions these days, I can tell having functions allows us to access tasks easily as well as to understand what the tasks are about in the script.</p>
          <h3>Wrap up</h3>
          <p>Honestly, I've only learned probably 0.000000001% of JavaScript by now, and there will be more to go. Trying to understand the concepts are algorithms is not easy task at all. In fact, I can't memorise them anyway. But what I'm confident about on my learning journey is that <span class="highlight">Practice makes perfect</span>. I'm looking forward to doing many drills and build up my muscle memory!</p>
