          <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
          <p>One thing for sure before doing this exercise was that I've never thought of learning the mechanism of brain function in this course. Remembering(learning) is a part of what we do on daily basis, and I've never questioned myself how it's done. Knowing how brain works when I try to remember something new affects a process of studying.</p>
          <p>In order to understand what Neuroplasticity is, let's go over what the internet says about the definition of it.</p>
          <figure class="box-reference">
            <h5>Neuroplasticity</h5>
            <p>The brain's ability to reorganise itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. Neuroplasticity allows the neurons (nerve cells) in the brain to compensate for injury and disease and to adjust their activities in response to new situations or to changes in their environment.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>What does this mean to my study? In learning situation, Neuroplasticity plays a role that helps us understand our brain is malleable and can keep learning at any age. I also found <span class="highlight">the 10 rules of Neuroplasticity</span>, which provides me a bit more contexts of Neuroplasticity. I've written down how I can benefit for my learning journey from the rules below:</p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p></p>
          <h5>1. Use it or lose it</h5>
          <p>If I don't practice skills frequently, I will end up with getting the skills deteriorated. Reminding myself a daily practice of coding might help me here.</p>
          <h5>2. Use it and improve it</h5>
          <p>When I find my coding skills function better than before, it could be a sign that I spent enough numbers of time to practice them.</p>
          <h5>3. Specificity</h5>
          <p>I must skilfully practice the exact tasks I want to improve. Narrowing down what to focus would be a good starting point.</p>
          <h5>4. Repetition matters</h5>
          <p>A high number of repetitions is necessary for building solid skills. I can achieve it by scheduling to do a bit of coding every day.</p>
          <h5>5. Intensity matters</h5>
          <p>A high number of repetitions, more frequency and higher difficulty can result in learning skills more efficiently. I'm literally in the middle of intense situation.</p>
          <h5>6. Time matters</h5>
          <p>Learning is a process rather than a single event with windows of opportunity opening for different skills at different times. I've chosen to join this program when I'm mentally, physically and financially ready.</p>
          <h5>7. Salience matters</h5>
          <p>Motivation and emotion have the power to influence the brain. The skills I learn must have some meaning, relevance or importance to me.</p>
          <h5>8. Age matters</h5>
          <p>Younger brains tend to change faster than older brains, but improvement is possible at any age. It's never too late to learn skills! I'm not teenager, but I can still learn!</p>
          <h5>9. Transference</h5>
          <p>Practicing one skill can result in improvement of a related skill. This will help me connect dots between different areas of study.</p>
          <h5>10. Interference</h5>
          <p>Compensation may make it harder to learn the proper way. I'm creating a space where there is the least interference in my study environment.</p>
          <h4>Another perspective on increase of neuroplasticity</h4>
          <p>Apart from the 10 rules of neuroplasticity, I found a very fascinating topic in terms of learning (aka. building a neural connection) during this exploration, which is <span class="highlight">forgetting</span>. I usually find it stressful to memorise something proactively. For instance, the process of remembering is like carrying a bucket full of water from the well, and walking very carefully to home. I would be worried if I drop them at some point. It sounds there isn't not much fun in it.</p>
          <p>When I encountered these two quotes below, it was mind-blowing because forgetting was something I would thought lastly.</p>
          <blockquote>Forgetting is not the opposite of remembering. In fact, forgetting can help memory!</blockquote>
          <p class="author-quote">Althea Need Kaminske &mdash; Cognitive Psychological Scientist</p>
          <blockquote>The more we've forgotten something that is harder to retrieve it since we last learned it or studied it, the greater the increase in learning will be.</blockquote>
          <p class="author-quote">Thomas Frank &mdash; YouTuber, author, and podcaster</p>
          <p>I agree that practicing retrieval of certain information helps us recall that information. As a result, we could probably build a stronger neural connection. I was very discouraged or hard on myself when I forgot something. Knowing that forgetting is a part of remembering makes me feel more relaxed during my learning time. When my mental pressure is drastically low, I'm aware I rather enjoy difficult challenges, which closely ties to the next section - Growth Mindset.</p>

          <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
          <p>According to Carol Dweck - American psychologist, growth mindset is basically a way of thinking about and dealing with challenges especially with failure. When it comes to understanding growth mindset, we can't separate it from understanding fixed mindset which is often compared with growth mindset.</p>

          <p>Learning growth mindset was one of my career development objectives in the past. It's been about a year since I made a deep dive into this topic, and I find revisiting this feels actually very powerful. I can acknowledge elements of both growth mindset and fixed mindset from the patterns of my actions in the past year. One of the positive impact I'm aware is excitement towards new challenges. Envisioning my success and executing my plans are very rewarding to me because I'm actually capable of making things happen.</p>
          <p>There is no secret that I still struggle with old me, which is putting unnecessary pressure on me when I progress things slowly. To take this pressure off, I could use a bit of reminder that having struggles is actually the time when I grow the most. In the previous section, I learned that remembering is similar to working out my muscles at gym. We do things that muscles have to struggle with and strain with. Then the muscles rebuild themselves and come back stronger.</p>
          <p>That is to say, struggles could be a sign that our brain has a thirst for more knowledges and experiences. When something gets wrong, we review why we got it wrong and really process that feedback. This process is essential to build a new neural connection, and growth mindset is a torchlight to spot a door to this rewarding journey.</p>
          <h3>So how does this insight play out through this course?</h3>
          <p>Now I have clearer understanding on the fact that I don’t understand something right now doesn’t mean that I'm not smart enough for whatever I'm trying. The next time when I bump into obstacles and have this uncomfortable feeling of frustration and desperation because I can’t wrap my head around, I will tell myself that trying to figure problems out alone or with someone is what matters the most.</p>
