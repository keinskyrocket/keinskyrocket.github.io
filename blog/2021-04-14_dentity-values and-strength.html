          <h3>Story about my ethical decision making</h3>
          <figure class="box-reference">
            <h5>Challenge</h5>
            <p>A situation where the committee members from my Japanese Drumming team discussed whether we should change our weekly rehearsal/practice day.</p>
          </figure>
          <h4>Background</h4>
          <p>I’m one of the committee members from Japanese Drumming team based in Auckland. We have about 20 performers with a wide range of diversity. According to the tradition of the team practice, we have set every Tuesday for individual practice and every Saturday for team rehearsal/practice. One day, we encountered a situation where it was impossible for several core members to come to the Tuesday practice at all because of their work shift or family obligations. This left them no choice to have opportunities to use the instruments and to focus on improvements of their skills like others on Tuesday.</p>
          <p>Moving practice day comes with lots of consequences. The venue hire could be challenging because of availability. There are possibilities where other members are not available on other days, which falls into the same issue. Even if we changed the individual practice day, these several members wouldn't be 100% sure if they could make it every week due to the characteristic of their life situation.</p>
          <p>This led our committee members to a very long conversion. Luckily, we have just developed our new team vision. This allowed us to follow the right direction when it comes to make a wiser decision. However, a process of balancing out team members' needs was very challenging.</p>
          <h4>Start of doubt</h4>
          <p>Weighing up the shared values among different team members seems like a never-ending job. When the committee members considered about an ultimate solution to make everyone happy, this approach led us to a dead-end. This is almost the same as asking ourselves a question like: how might we decide one team colour while we hear 20 different voices from the team?</p>
          <p>As mentioned above, we have just finalised our new team vision. The vision can be broken into 3 keywords which are Growth, Inclusive and Introspective. The keyword that really made us think was "inclusive" when discussing about the possibility to change the day of our individual practice.</p>
          <p>What does inclusive mean to us? What if we found a few members unhappy with our new decision, does this mean we didn't hear them at all? Does this make us not inclusive? During this long conversation with the other committee members, I realised we often mentioned "what if" phrases. This is when I started feeling that something was not right.</p>
          <h4>Blinded by biases</h4>          
          <p>Honestly, I could have suggested more efficient way which is to run a quick survey and make a decision based on majority rules. In fact, I love efficiency. Democracy! (Kidding...) This issue was not the only thing we needed to consider. Problems are piling up by themselves as we all know. We operate the team. We choose more efficient and easier way to do so. That's how community should be operated whether it is big or not. We need to get things moving!</p>
          <p>Well, at least this was one aspect of me speaking to myself at that time. So, this is where my conflict came in. The members are my friends. They are like my family. I simply can't neglect their feelings. Let's put myself in their shoes and have a think. Mmm, I wouldn't want to be treated like I was going to do to them in a democratic way. I have no intention to be dominant by ignoring minority. Tricky, tricky...</p>
          <p>When I stopped looking for a quick fix and started telling myself that it's ok not to fix it right away, I suddenly felt lighter. This idea provided me a space to rethink about the whole situation and to try focusing on others.</p>
          <p>During the committee meeting, the entire committee members including myself were so blinded by looking for "a quick fix" based on assumptions, and didn't think of planning "a new journey" based on evidence. In other words, we didn't think of valuing a process that we put efforts to care about others and find out what the team really wanted.</p>
          <h4>Start of building empathy</h4>
          <p>There is a major term that I've picked up from my previous position, which is User Experience(UX). UX is a process where people create a product(or a service) that provides meaningful and relevant experience to users. This idea has changed my values and ethics dramatically.</p>
          <p>Rather than jumping into a solution, I started taking a step to listen and observe what is really happening right here. This behaviour puts me into a position where I can be less egoistic and more empathetic. A powerful phrase I often use is "How might we...?" This phrase has become the first step for me to create a journey of meaningful experience.</p>
          <p>So what exactly did I do about the issue with the Tuesday practice? Here is a list of things I actioned with the committee members. We:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>created a safe space for the team to speak freely.</li>
            <li>asked many questions to articulate the actual needs of the team.</li>
            <li>explained their voice matters.</li>
            <li>clarified we experiment first and review whether we are doing ok with new changes.</li>
            <li>advocated the power of changes and the changes are constant.</li>
            <li>focused on listening and observing.</li>
            <li>expressed how grateful it is to see their honestly.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These are the contexts that outlined a meaningful experience that brought the team together, which I believe defines inclusive.</p>
          <h4>Checkpoint so far</h4>
          <p>Now we have sort of temporary solution which is to have the individual practice day on Wednesday. Those members who couldn't come to the Tuesdays sometimes show up the new Wednesdays. Other members who came to the Tuesdays still show up to the Wednesdays as well. What really made me happy was that the team appreciated the whole process we took to come this far. </p>
          <p>It's always good to have a positive outcome. However, having a solution is temporary and it will become a checkpoint sooner or later. The important thing I value here is that how we get to the destination does matter more than the destination itself.</p>
          <h4>Cultural influence to my values and identity</h4>
          <p>Before I familiarised myself with UX, I've already known about the concept subconsciously. I just couldn't explain about it in written format. This is because there is a deep-rooted Japanese culture called <a class="external-link" href="https://www.japan.travel/en/au/experience/culture/omotenashi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Omotenashi</a>, meaning to wholeheartedly look after guests. The term is a microcosm of the country itself, representing the Japanese mindset of hospitality centring around care rather than expectation.</p>
          <p>This mind-set has been living in me, and I could barely be aware of it until friends told me what I thought normal wasn't normal after I migrated to New Zealand. It is really hard to articulate or translate a concept you are too familiar in a way that others can understand. It is like teaching your mother language to foreigners with why it is the way it is. For us, it is because it has been this way.</p>
          <p>Another interesting aspect of Omotenashi is that the root of the word is <span class="highlight">Omoteuranashi</span>, which translates to "not having two sides". If my action didn't come from the heart without expectations of getting something in return, I would always feel ashamed of what I do. I'm very confident that this is where my values and ethics (authenticity and harmony) came from.</p>

          <h3>Define my core personality, values and strengths</h3>
          <p>There is no big surprise that there are some gaps between self-refection and perception from other people when it comes to outlining one's identity. I interviewed with my partner, my friends and my peers on 3 areas to kill my cognitive biases.</p>
          <figure class="box-callout">
            <h4>My view</h4>
            <h5>1. Core personality</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Value authentic and harmonic relationship with others.</li>
              <li>Have an independent approach to life, but still enjoy the company of a few close friends.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>2. Strengths</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Articulate the heart of things, and pierce what people matters such as feelings and needs.</li>
              <li>Turn foes into allies.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>3. Limitations</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Frustrated when encountering people who make the same mistakes repeatedly.</li>
              <li>Not always forgiving to those who make excuses and procrasticate plans.</li>
            </ul>
          </figure>
          <figure class="box-callout">
            <h4>Evidence gathered from others</h4>
            <h5>1. Core personality</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>An analytical thinker who likes to create art and order in the world around him, who is often more interested in the deeper side of things. &mdash; <em>My partner</em></li>
              <li>Exudes positivity, open-mindedness, diversified thinking, and inclusivity. &mdash; <em>Friend A</em></li>
              <li>Without a guideline for personality types I would characterise him as a: details/dominant(-leader style no arrogant style). type. &mdash; <em>Friend B</em></li>
              <li>The most competent creator I have ever worked with. Articulate, focused and striving for perfection! I appreciate his viewpoint and wealth of knowledge. &mdash; <em>Peer A</em></li>
            </ul>
            <h5>2. Strengths</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Considers others point of view (empathetic), respects agreements (punctual), has good communication skills, warm and kind hearted. &mdash; <em>My partner</em></li>
              <li>Focused and timely work ethic, the ability to balance play/fun and work, you also are able to manage disputes in a calm and peaceful manner and be mindful of opinions and ideas that differ from your own. &mdash; <em>Friend A</em></li>
              <li>Attention to detail. Gives time and effort, Doesn't take short cuts. Listening. Sexy/handsome? That's a social strength.. whether we like it or not &mdash; <em>Friend B</em></li>
              <li>Eagerness to excel in learning. Has really great communication about priorities and timelines to manage expectations. Learns things incredibly quickly. &mdash; <em>Peer A</em></li>
            </ul>
            <h5>3. Limitations</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Occasionally hot tempered / gets annoyed when people aren’t “up to speed” or on his level, sometimes inflexible when trying new things. &mdash; <em>My partner</em></li>
              <li>Honestly, this is hard to answer. I suppose your limitations are what you do not know. And that goes for anybody. There are many things we do not know or think we know but do not know completely. From the few things we’ve worked on together, I often felt you were very good at listening and giving advice with an open mind, which makes this question hard to answer. &mdash; <em>Friend A</em></li>
              <li>Not very resilient to stresses of life. Annoyed by other people's failures. Tendency to over complicate, perhaps more on the Comms side only. &mdash; <em>Friend B</em></li>
              <li>Doubts his abilities far too much! Always willing to experiment, but within the constraints of his skill sets. &mdash; <em>Peer A</em></li>
            </ul>
          </figure>
          <h4>Strengths would help me in my learning journey</h4>
          <p>Being self-contained allows me to build my own schedule of leaning journey and operate it at smoothly at my own pace. I also know when and who to reach out if help is required.</p>
          <p>Considering (and keeping my eyes) others during team play would be another aspect I could contribute to a group. I feel comfortable with not only keeping things on track but also paying attention to people's feelings.</p>
          <h4>How might these intersect with my learning obstacles?</h4>
          <p>Considering (and keeping my eyes) others during team play would be another aspect I could contribute to a group. I feel comfortable with not only keeping things on track but also paying attention to people's feelings.</p>
          <h4>Working as a team</h4>
          <p>The most recent working experience that I had with my peers was almost the best team experience in my career. There are a couple of key factors that led us to succeed.</p>
          <p>Firstly, I've become responsible with my own mastery and learned to trust and respect what my allies execute with their skill-set by knowing our own boundaries. This allowed us to outline a picture of how to get help from each other to accomplish our shared goals. We could kill lots of overlaps of tasks and publish many contents quickly.</p>
          <p>Secondary, we try to remind ourself of growth mindset, which is "This is the best we can do so far, and we will continue to grow". Instead of criticising our work, we acknowledge the work we've done came from the skill-set we had at that time. We articulate what could be improved for the next attempt, and we simply execute a refined action.</p>
          <p>The common limitation we all had was that we sometime push ourselves too hard, and tend to end up with burnout. It happened when Covid-19 came in and we all had to shift to a remote working situation. There were so many adjustments to make, and we subconsciously overflow our fake enthusiasm. We learned that it's ok to be not ok. And this is the time when we need to slow down or even pause and have a rest.</p>
          <h3>Wrap up</h3>
          <p>I'm very grateful that I've encountered many beautiful souls who spent their precious time for me to provide reflection on me. I appreciate their honestly and of course lots of kind words. This exercise has made me more comfortable with the way I learn and reminded me of how fortunate I am.</p>
