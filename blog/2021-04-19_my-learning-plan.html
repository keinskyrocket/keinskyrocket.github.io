          <h3>My goals and career pathway</h3>
          <p>For the next couple of years after the finish of this course, I would like to focus improving my front-end skill-sets. Currently, the highest needs of learning in particular is javascript which is essential for my next position.</p>
          <p>In regards to the short-term goal, I would like to thicken knowledge about web development and explore server-side related subjects within web development which I'm not entirely sure where to begin with yet.</p>
          <p>My long-term goal is to become a full-stack developer and I'm looking at around 5 years from now to start familiarising myself with more back-end skill-set.</p>
          <h3>Strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3>
          <h4>Personal learning</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Strengths</strong> &mdash; Well balanced between structured and non-structured scheduling.</li>
            <li><strong>Limitations</strong> &mdash; Less flexible while I'm in the deep focus.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Team learning</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Strengths</strong> &mdash; Keep things on track. Provide a different perspective.</li>
            <li><strong>Limitations</strong> &mdash; Easily overwhelmed by fast-paced learning with a big group.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Human skills to develop</h3>
          <p>I would like to develop a new mindset or discover a new perspective that help me not worrying about wasting my time by dealing with inefficiency.</p>
          <p>I would also like to be more transparent.</p>
          <h3>How to manage myself</h3>
          <p>I normally allocate my tasks with buffers and like to follow my plans, but not too strictly. I like to be flexible about time-boxing. For instance, I would like to allocate extra time on a task if I finish another one quicker. This provides a creative and free mental space for me to be the most productive.</p>
          <figure class="box-callout">
            <h5>Level 1 - A change of pace</h5>
            <p>When losing focus or being distracted by accidental obstacles, I need a trigger to switch back on.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Coffee/tea break</li>
              <li>Taking a short nap (up to 20 mins)</li>
            </ul>
          </figure>
          <figure class="box-callout">
            <h5>Level 2 - Unlock a blocker</h5>
            <p>This is at the stage where I spend too much time on a single task and still can't find a way out by myself.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Gym/lunch break</li>
              <li>Switch to a different task</li>
              <li>Start pairing with other cohort</li>
            </ul>
          </figure>
          <figure class="box-callout">
            <h5>Level 3 - Affirmation and encouragement</h5>
            <p>I could mentally be fatigued. Perhaps, lots of negative illusions such as failure, self-doubt and anxiety are agitating me at this point.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>I will say magical words: It's ok to feel stressed.</li>
              <li>Talk to others about my feelings.</li>
              <li>Do things that I'm good at.</li>
            </ul>
          </figure>
          <figure class="box-callout">
            <h5>Level 4 - Lower the expectation and requirements</h5>
            <p>After going through the level 1 to 3, this is the point where I need a proper break from what I've been doing. It is normally because the plan isn't well-structured.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Restructure my plans and narrow down what I can do.</li>
            </ul>
          </figure>
          <h3>A way of getting help</h3>
          <p>I will make sure to reduce ambiguity and increase clarify when it comes to asking for help. For instance, I will try providing the format of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>what my issue is</li>
            <li>the contexts</li>
            <li>what feedback/help I need</li>
            <li>follow up (what happened after the issue was solved).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Predominantly, I will reach out for help on slack channel. I have a mentor and a practice coach outside EDA, so I will reach out to them as a secondary point of contact when I need help.</p>
          <h3>Things I expect from the facilitation team</h3>
          <p>In the beginning of the course, I would probably have no idea what to ask in terms of help. I would appreciate some recommendations or check-ins as to how my progress is going. As we are going towards the bootcamp period, I would appreciate some feedback on my overall learning performance. During the bootcamp, I would probably struggle with the speed of leaning in a group as I normally pause and digest information at my own pace when working independently. I would appreciate some awareness towards people like me to catch up with the rest of the team.</p>
          <h3>Block out time</h3>
          <p>I normally allocate <span class="highlight">the core time for study from 8:00am to 6:00pm</span>, and these are just guideline. Saturday is my off day. I try to stay away from the computer on this say to recharge myself. I would see Sunday is my supplimental study day when I want to review or prep something.</p>
