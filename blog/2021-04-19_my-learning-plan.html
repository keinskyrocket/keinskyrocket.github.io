            Learning Plan describes how I operate within the context of Foundations and Bootcamp at Dev Academy. The plan for Foundations was created at the beginning the course. The plan for Bootcamp is re-evaluation of the plan for Foundations.

            <h3>My goals and career pathway</h3>
            <p>
              I'm passionate about using my skills for building user(customer) centred experience. The platform would be websites or digital products. I'm envisioning myself to bridge the gap between design and technology, essentially allowing for the more technically-oriented side of the team to understand what the vision of the project is and what the designers want.
            </p>
            <h3>Strengths and limitations in Bootcamp</h3>
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Determination</strong> &mdash; I don't give up what I started or even on people who are in a same team together. I'm always up for exploring plan B if plan A doesn't work. It would be perseverance that drives me this way, or discipline that keeps me going.</li>
              <li><strong>Solidarity</strong> &mdash; There is always a situation like where a member of the team is not available, and some of us have to cover his/her role(responsibility) to move forward as a team. I'm happy to be supportive in this context, which I believe the essential of teamwork.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Limitations</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Self-contained</strong> &mdash; When I'm especially in the zone, my mind tends to be drawn into a limited amount of information. This is the moment when I become less observant of what's happening around me.</li>
              <li><strong>Efficiency-oriented</strong> &mdash; I wouldn't say this always comes down to my limitations. However, it could be a burden in a situation where empathy is most needed while there are many tasks to get done.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Non-technical challenges in Bootcamp</h3>
            <p>
              Potentially, my biggest challenge normally falls in a situation where I need to make a public speech or a presentation in from of a big group of people. I feel terrified especially when I'm not given enough time to prepare for this occasion. 
            </p>
            <h3>Human skills to develop</h3>
            <p>
              I would like to explore how to provide constructive feedback and how to handle situations where feedback I received is not helpful. This is mainly because I prefer avoiding unnecessary conflicts to be more productive while working in pair or team.
            </p>
            <h3>Expectations from Bootcamp team</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Constructive feedback</li>
              <li>Evidence based advise</li>
              <li>Transparency</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Expectations of myself in Bootcamp</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Be concise but informative when asking for help. I will provide enough context about my problem and will clarify what I want to get out of.</li>
              <li>Be punctual.</li>
              <li>Flag it before it's too late. I will avoid last minute dramas which can happen by procrastinating.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

            <h3>My goals and career pathway</h3>
            <p>For the next couple of years after the finish of this course, I would like to focus improving my front-end skill-sets. Currently, the highest needs of learning in particular is javascript which is essential for my next position.</p>
            <p>In regards to the short-term goal, I would like to thicken knowledge about web development and explore server-side related subjects within web development which I'm not entirely sure where to begin with yet.</p>
            <p>My long-term goal is to become a full-stack developer and I'm looking at around 5 years from now to start familiarising myself with more back-end skill-set.</p>
            <h3>Strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3>
            <h4>Personal learning</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Strengths</strong> &mdash; Well balanced between structured and non-structured scheduling.</li>
              <li><strong>Limitations</strong> &mdash; Less flexible while I'm in the deep focus.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Team learning</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Strengths</strong> &mdash; Keep things on track. Provide a different perspective.</li>
              <li><strong>Limitations</strong> &mdash; Easily overwhelmed by fast-paced learning with a big group.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Human skills to develop</h3>
            <p>I would like to develop a new mindset or discover a new perspective that help me not worrying about wasting my time by dealing with inefficiency.</p>
            <p>I would also like to be more transparent.</p>
            <h3>How to manage myself</h3>
            <p>I normally allocate my tasks with buffers and like to follow my plans, but not too strictly. I like to be flexible about time-boxing. For instance, I would like to allocate extra time on a task if I finish another one quicker. This provides a creative and free mental space for me to be the most productive.</p>
            <figure class="box-callout">
              <h5>Level 1 - A change of pace</h5>
              <p>When losing focus or being distracted by accidental obstacles, I need a trigger to switch back on.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Coffee/tea break</li>
                <li>Taking a short nap (up to 20 mins)</li>
              </ul>
            </figure>
            <figure class="box-callout">
              <h5>Level 2 - Unlock a blocker</h5>
              <p>This is at the stage where I spend too much time on a single task and still can't find a way out by myself.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Gym/lunch break</li>
                <li>Switch to a different task</li>
                <li>Start pairing with other cohort</li>
              </ul>
            </figure>
            <figure class="box-callout">
              <h5>Level 3 - Affirmation and encouragement</h5>
              <p>I could mentally be fatigued. Perhaps, lots of negative illusions such as failure, self-doubt and anxiety are agitating me at this point.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>I will say magical words: It's ok to feel stressed.</li>
                <li>Talk to others about my feelings.</li>
                <li>Do things that I'm good at.</li>
              </ul>
            </figure>
            <figure class="box-callout">
              <h5>Level 4 - Lower the expectation and requirements</h5>
              <p>After going through the level 1 to 3, this is the point where I need a proper break from what I've been doing. It is normally because the plan isn't well-structured.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Restructure my plans and narrow down what I can do.</li>
              </ul>
            </figure>
            <h3>A way of getting help</h3>
            <p>I will make sure to reduce ambiguity and increase clarify when it comes to asking for help. For instance, I will try providing the format of:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>what my issue is</li>
              <li>the contexts</li>
              <li>what feedback/help I need</li>
              <li>follow up (what happened after the issue was solved).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Predominantly, I will reach out for help on slack channel. I have a mentor and a practice coach outside EDA, so I will reach out to them as a secondary point of contact when I need help.</p>
            <h3>Things I expect from the facilitation team</h3>
            <p>In the beginning of the course, I would probably have no idea what to ask in terms of help. I would appreciate some recommendations or check-ins as to how my progress is going. As we are going towards the bootcamp period, I would appreciate some feedback on my overall learning performance. During the bootcamp, I would probably struggle with the speed of leaning in a group as I normally pause and digest information at my own pace when working independently. I would appreciate some awareness towards people like me to catch up with the rest of the team.</p>
            <h3>Block out time</h3>
            <p>I normally allocate <span class="highlight">the core time for study from 8:00am to 6:00pm</span>, and these are just guideline. Saturday is my off day. I try to stay away from the computer on this say to recharge myself. I would see Sunday is my supplemental study day when I want to review or prep something.</p>
