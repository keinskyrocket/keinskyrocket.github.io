          <h3>The end of the faundation</h3>
          <p>
            When looking back a month ago, I couldn't read JavaScript at all. I had a big fear of using Terminal, too. What really surprised me is that I'm not who I was a month ago. I didn't need a year to transform myself into something new. I've decided to leave my reflection on the foundation so that I can remember my original intention of this challenge. 
          </p>
          <h4>3 new things I learned about yourself and my ego</h4>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>I can program!</strong> &mdash; I've always thought becoming a developer and writing a program are someone else's job. I made a decision to become someone who I never thought would become.It's still a bit surreal that I can program.</li>
            <li><strong>Never too late to learn</strong> &mdash; I've never imagined I would study at school after I turned 40. It was simply because I lived in my limitations. </li>
            <li><strong>Grateful to struggle</strong> &mdash; It may sounds insane, but I learned the most when struggling. I needed the struggles to grow wiser. It was painful to face the struggles, but now the fact that I'm facing the struggles means I've encountered a great opportunity to grow.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            As far as my ego goes, it like to label things: better or worse, right or wrong, and success or failure so on. It basically comes from comparisons. I'm aware when it does and I've come to pause what it does when it's doing. I think this is where I am  at the moment.
          </p>
          <h4>Role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming</h4>
          <p>
            These elements help me articluate why I am the way I am. This provides me with clear indications to the next step and deep inghts to make wiser decisions. 
          </p>
          <h4>Thing that surprised me the most</h4>
          <p>
            Knowing how brain works in learning definitely transformed my mindset as well as the way I study. I used feed dissapointed in myself when I couldn't remember new things quickly. I labed myself a big failure because of it. I also doubted myself if I didn't make enough efforts to learn. As a result, I felt pressured and demotivated during my old learning process. I have no wonder why I didn't like studying when I was young.
          </p>
          <p>
            Accommodating a healthy mental space is really powerful. I learned how to do so after I gained more understandings on what Nueroplasticity is and Growth Mindset. Here comes my new magic word: 
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            Learning at my own pace means ticking clock on my potential while forgetting is an important part of memory. When I know I don't understand a thing yet, I also know I will. &mdash; Keisuke
          </blockquote>
          <h4>The most challenging aspects</h4>
          <p>
            There is a gab between how I view myself and how others view me. Knowing everyone has their own interpretetion doesn't really help me see which is more reliable source of information when it comes to identifying my personality. There are so many different contexts in situations where we can be in, and we channel our emotions and thoughts based on these contexts. Their perceprion on my personality is differ depending on experience we shared.
          </p>
          <p>
            I could easily be mulipulated by how they want to identify me even though I think I know who I am by now. Exploring own identity is never ending challenge. 
          </p>
          <h4>My thoughts on the core learning with Dev Academy</h4>
          <p>
            I value the time I spent for the core learning. In fact, this is one of the main reasons why I chose this course over handreds of other options. It might sound a bit wired, but I can't recall if I've ever learned how to be a human - how to build human skills when I was young. Exploring own identity opens up lots of opportunities to articulate why we are the way we are. Knowing it is a good starting point to figure out the next action. Buidling better empathy - emotional intelligence is something we really need to continue doing in this digital world. And finally, growth mindset shows us the world so differently and pisitively.
          </p>
          <p>
            I belive finding a good job is not about presenting the best skills I have. Finding the right fit is what does matter the most. We are supposed to have a work that enriches our life. Any slavely work environments never make us happy. I really appreciate I've learned tricks to see through these key factoers so that I can make wiser decisions.
          </p>
          <h4>Was it a waste of my time to study the core learning?</h4>
          <p>
            This is the easiest question of all that I was asked through out this course. It is not a waste at all. It is quite opposite, really. I personally think this should be taught in any learning environments.
