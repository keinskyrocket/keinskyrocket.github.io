          <h3>What is Emotional Quotient?</h3>
          <p>Emotional Quotient(EQ) considers how we think about ourselves and how we think about and act toward others. EQ is not set in stone. We spend time each and every day working on our EQ while we spend years going to school to build our Intelligence Quotient(IQ).</p>
          <h4>5 Components of EQ</h4>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Self-awareness</strong> &mdash; the ability to recognize and understand your moods, emotions and drives, as well as their effect on others.</li>
            <li><strong>Self-regulation</strong> &mdash; the ability to control or redirect disruptive impulses and moods and the propensity to suspend judgement and think before acting. In practice, it is your ability to influence your emotional clarity.</li>
            <li><strong>Motivation</strong> &mdash; a passion to work for reasons that go beyond the external drive for knowledge, utility, surroundings, others, power or methodology and are based on an internal drive or propensity to pursue goals with energy and persistence.</li>
            <li><strong>Social-awareness</strong> &mdash; the ability to understand the emotional makeup of other people and how your words and actions affect others. Summed up, it’s all about assessing others.</li>
            <li><strong>Social-regulation</strong> &mdash; the ability to influence the emotional clarity of others through a proficiency in managing relationships and building networks.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
          <p>I'm going to look at 2 different aspects to pursue why EQ is important.</p>
          <p>Firstly, let's take a look at the workplace we have been in these days. We used to keep emotions in check while pretending not to feel anything as if this is what working professionals should be. However, any savvy companies are realising that recognising emotions exist can lead to healthier work environments. Being aware of their own and others’ emotions and act accordingly can influence how well employees interact with their colleagues.</p>
          <p>Another aspect of EQ is that a high EQ will facilitate flexibility and enable an individual to build and drive successful teams and to be agile and responsive as needed. On the other hand, a low EQ will typically present as insensitivity, arrogance, or even aggression and volatility. For instance, It can be seen in bullying, harassment, and demotivated staff. </p>
          <p>The workplace is generally a melting pot of different personalities, skills, strengths, and emotions. Allowing emotions at work and recognizing the benefits of doing so matter more than it used to. A high IQ alone is no longer enough.</p>
